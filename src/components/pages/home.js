      <p>
        My name is Daniel Packer, and I am a full-stack web developer and
        digital marketing professional. I can build the site you want and then
        bring people to it.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
        I love to make things and see how people react to them, so outside of my
        career I love things like cooking, wood working, and design. I am an
        Arizona native, and I currently live in Gilbert, AZ with my wife, our
        two daughters and our dog.
